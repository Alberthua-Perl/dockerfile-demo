# Note:
#   If you want to create image used as basic jekyll environment,
#   you should comment previous three directives, e.g, VOLUME, 
#   WORKDIR, ENTRYPOINT and rebuild it.
#   The Dockfile is to be used deploy jekyll build environment
#   to build blog just once.
#
#   According to jekyll version and blog configure, if you want to
#   build your blog, sometimes you will get error reports during
#   image creating, so install some .gem packages into image to 
#   resolv the issue.
